# Report
## Please give evidence that you have finished Tasks I and II
The all files in the directory [practice](./practice) is the evidence that we did the whole works. We search many references to get the work done.

## please explain how you amplify the DNS response
Frist, we set the rd(recursive desired) to 1 to enable recursive functionality.
Second, we try many query types and choose the one which has the largest response.
Similarly, we try many domain names and choose the one which has the best performance.


## please propose a solution that can defend against the DoS attack based on the DNS reflection
